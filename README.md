# BERT_LLM_model
Large Language models are AI systems trained on massive text data. They use deep learning, specifically Transformative architectures, and can be used for text generation, summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, and Q&A.

I have been learning different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I was always fascinated with GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek; that's when I came across a simpler pre-trained model called BERT, developed by Google. I had to use it and give it a try,

And so, I created a simple Sentiment analysis model by freezing the undesired layers of the pre-trained model.
